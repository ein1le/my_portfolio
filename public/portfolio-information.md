## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hi there! I'm **Ein**, an integrated master's student in Engineering, driven by a passion for continuous learning and staying at the forefront of digital transformation. With a strong foundation in problem-solving and project-based work in academia, I've developed a deep interest in the intersection of **Data Science, Generative AI Engineering, MLOps, and Data-driven Infrastructure** with a sprinkle of **Full-stack Web Development** and **UI/UX design** from side projects along the way.

Despite my engineering background, I am always working in projects in these areas of interest, taking a wide approach to a diverse range of topics. I'm actively seeking **off-cycle**, **internship**, and **graduate** opportunities in London. 

I'm especially keen to explore operational and infrastructure roles in the **financial** and **technology** sectors, such as Quantitative Research, Risk Management, and Agentic Design.

If you're working on something exciting, I'd love to connect!

## ðŸš€ About This Website

This is my interactive portfolio, built to showcase my academic, professional, and extracurricular experiences in a centralised space, as well as my technical projects and skills in a fun way. It is entirely built on a GitHub repository, using **Vite, React, Tailwind CSS,** and deployed using **Vercel**.

The site is currently in development but features:

- Modern VS-code IDE inspired UI
- Interactive explorer, timeline, and projects with dynamic sizing
- Markdown imports, and PDF modal viewer to open reports and publications
- Interactive database with skills which can be queried using an SQL interface
- Custom chatbot using Open AI API
- Integrated python interpreter in the terminal using Pydiode
- On-hover animated experience and project cards with expandable descriptions
- GitHub API links to pull latest commits and repository activity
- And other easter eggs...

Have fun exploring the page!

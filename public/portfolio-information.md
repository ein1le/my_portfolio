# Ein's Portfolio

## 👋 Introduction

Hi there! I'm **Ein**, an integrated master's student in Engineering, driven by a passion for continuous learning and staying at the forefront of digital transformation. With a strong foundation in problem-solving and project-based work in academia, I've developed a deep interest in the intersection of Data Science, Generative AI, MLOps, and Data-driven Infrastructure—with a sprinkle of Front-end Development and UI/UX design from side projects along the way.

Despite my engineering background, I am always working towards projects in these areas of interest, taking a wide approach to a diverse range of topics. I'm actively seeking off-cycle, internship, and graduate opportunities within operational and infrastructure roles in the financial and technology sectors, such as Quantitative Research, Risk Management, and AI Automation Engineering.

If you're working on something exciting, I'd love to connect!
